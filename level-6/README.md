## Mission Objective

Find a way to make the application request an external file which will cause it to execute an `alert()`.

## Analysis

This lab objective is straightforward forward we have to load an external javascript file to execute an `alert()` function. The page adds a script tag with the¬†`src`¬†attribute pointing to the URL fragment‚Äôs value. If you take a look at the page source code you will find a `setInnerText()` function that prevents the loading of the script file if the URL starts with `http` or `https`.

## Conclusion

Even if the application blocks URLs starting with `http` or `https`. It can be bypassed by a [Protocol-relative URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protocol-relative_URL) or with [data:URL scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data).
